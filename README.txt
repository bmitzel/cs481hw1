10-6
checkmate, stalemate
fix routine ( add outside coordinates)
when game ends, result # of moves


MAJOR:
graph generating ( both heuristic) use herative depth first
text string for move
depth of level at (keep track of)
convert board objects to node objects
node: list(children)
lookahead variable: determine how deep we go.
