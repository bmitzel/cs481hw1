10-6
move players randomly check with Brick
checkmate, stalemate
fix routine ( add outside coordinates)
update list of pieces, beginning, clear list, grab new list
when game ends, result # of moves


MAJOR:
graph generating ( both heuristic) use herative depth first
text string for move
depth of level at (keep track of)
convert board objects to node objects
node: list(children)
lookahead variable: determine how deep we go.
